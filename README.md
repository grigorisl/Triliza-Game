# Triliza-Game

Develop a Trilizza game where two players play as X and O. The player who completes three identical symbols or numbers in any dimension of the table—horizontally, vertically, or diagonally—wins the game. The main() method should control the flow of the game, such as determining which player plays each turn (switching between the two players). It should also read the symbol that each player inputs from standard input and display the Trilizza grid graphically after each move. Additionally, you should implement a method that checks (after each move) if the player who made the move has won. The program should handle the case of a tie, and it should not allow a player to place a symbol in a position that is already occupied.

note: Two integers separated by a space (e.g., 0 1 or 2 2)
